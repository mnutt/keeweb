**KeeWeb is an open source self hosted password manager app compatible with KeePass.**

KeeWeb allows you to create and manage password files. As cross-platform web app it replaces your different apps which are hardly synced on all devices and OS.

This is a Sandstorm port of KeeWeb based on [KeePass web app (unofficial)](https://github.com/antelle/keeweb).
